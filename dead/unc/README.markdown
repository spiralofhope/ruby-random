A helper to uncompress files.

NOT WORKING

----

This project is at least as old as 2009-03-25

NOTE -- This scripting relies on my common libraries.

This was a convoluted and unnecessary thing to explore, to learn a bunch of aspects of the system and of Ruby.

These notes exist here, but I don't know if they're any good at all.. It's been so long since I've looked at this stuff that I don't know if I got anything working.  I suspect I did not.

I made `~/bin/unc` as a symbolic link to my proper `unc.rb` program.
